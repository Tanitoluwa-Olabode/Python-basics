What I learned:
- How to use variables in Python
- How Python performs arithmetic operations
- How to use print() to display results

Why this project matters to me:
This project helped me understand the basics of programming and gave me confidence to continue learning Python.

Next steps:
I plan to improve this project by adding user input and more operations.
